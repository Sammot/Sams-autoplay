# Sams-autoplay
This is a python application that is meant to replace YouTube auto-play, it scans your recommended feed for videos that are made by the creator you're currently watching and randomly selects one of them. 

It's a limited and buggy application but it could be nice alternative to YouTube randomly auto-playing videos you dislike. I would gladly accept anyone wanting to contribute to and improve this program.

At its current state you need to leave your mouse hovering over the mute button in the youtube timeline, or any other area that keeps the timeline from fading away.

You will need to enter in your google account details, the program has no capability to communicate your information to me. It is safe. There is a great deal of unfinished code in it.

If it doesn't work then ensure you have google chrome installed or the latest version of it and python 3.6.0 installed. If you don't have these installed, i've included the correct installers for these prerequisites in the "prerequisites" folder of the program directory.
