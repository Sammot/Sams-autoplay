# Sams-autoplay
This is a python application that is meant to replace YouTube auto-play, it scans your recommended feed for videos that are made by the creator you're currently watching and randomly selects one of them. It's a limited and buggy application but it could be nice alternative to YouTube randomly auto-playing videos you dislike. I would gladly accept anyone wanting to contribute to and improve this program.
